# dumby-bot-source-code
This is the source code to my discord.py project which is a bot that has numerous features like moderation commands, Api commands, and soon to be anti-spam, anti-self promotion and more. This is a work in progress and things will be added to it over time while getting closer and closer to being complete. This was originally a personal bot so i will be removing lots of commands that are just for fun like gifs and pictures. I am open to suggestions and with that.
Happy coding,

Also, I have no clue if i have to cite API usages or not but I am going to be safe and mention the api's I used:

  For the random quotes command, I used this api: https://rapidapi.com/martin.svoboda/api/quotes15
  and for the second api I use for the COVID-19 info: https://covidtracking.com/data/api
